Comments: This is a Java implementation of a deck of cards that will deal out
          a specific amount of cards to an amount of players. Created in NetBeans
          to run create an instance of Dealer, the first argument is the amount
          of players, the second is the amount of cards per player. Then tell
          dealer to deal. Dont forget to shuffle.
